        A personal project I wanted to explore was to create a poster in my first language, which is Mandarin. I decided to make the poster about the TV series “Breaking Bad”, due to its popularity in China as well as the United States. Another challenge was to generally give an idea using visuals of what the show is like, and condensing that idea into one poster.
