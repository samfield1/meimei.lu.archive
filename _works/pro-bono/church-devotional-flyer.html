        Another flyer I was asked to design was one for a church devotional centered around temples. I made it look like a very simple collage with an emphasis onthe sweeping photo of my churchâ€™s temple located inMaryland. The idea was to communicate that the temple is the destination and the inspiring object that is always there, similar to the moon, or mountains.
