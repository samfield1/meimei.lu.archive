        I was asked by the local unit of my church to design a flyer for a picnic that would be combining multiple other church units from the Northern DC Metropolitian Area, the Southern DC Metropolitan Area, and the New York City Metropolitan area. These regional church units traveled to Kensington, Maryland, to attend the Open House for the Washington, D.C. Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
