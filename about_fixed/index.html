              ><br />I am Meimei Lu, an undergraduate pursuing a BFA in graphic
              design at the George Washington University. I have designed
              freelance work, and I have had my work exhibited at the Hirshhorn
              Museum of Modern Art in Washington, DC.<br /><br />Graphic design
              began for me when I was 12. I became part of a community of
              teenagers on Instagram who ran accounts dedicated to their
              favorite book, movie, or TV series, and created graphics about the
              characters in those fictional worlds. From then onwards, designing
              graphics about my beloved fictional worlds became the medium of
              art I loved the most. <br /><br />When I am away from my laptop, I
              am busy writing poems, playing video games, and trying to fill up
              my sketchbook.</span
