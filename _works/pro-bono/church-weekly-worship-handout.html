        The missionaries in my local church unit asked me to design a weekly worship handheld flyer that they could hand out to newcomers at church, that explains
everything they need to know, such as when church
services begin, and where the chapel is located. Since
this handout was designed with newcomers to church in mind, I wanted it to look gentle and warm, with a
graphic of Christ in the middle, with His arms open.
